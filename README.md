# Personalized Learning
In a world where students struggle to stay engaged and motivated, your team's mission is to create an innovative solution that turns the process of studying into an interactive and rewarding experience. 
We want you to build a platform or app that gamifies studying—whether it’s for school, exams, skill development, or professional growth—by making the learning process fun, engaging, and effective. 
The university needs this game or tool to be easily accessible and intuitive enough for all students.
